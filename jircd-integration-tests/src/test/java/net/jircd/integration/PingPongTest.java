 * FR-039: a client-initiated {@code PING} is answered with an immediate {@code PONG} on any

 * own keep-alive probing of that connection. Since 005-fix-batch-conformance FR-005, {@code PONG}
 * carries the server's own name as well as the echoed token (two params, in that order); a bare
 * {@code PING} with no token at all is rejected (FR-006), never given a fabricated one.
