# Contract: Server-to-Client Numeric Replies

Like [irc-protocol-commands.md](./irc-protocol-commands.md), this contract
has two layers:

1. **Wire-protocol recognition** (`jircd-protocol`) — the complete RFC
   1459/2812 numeric reply catalog, plus `417 ERR_INPUTTOOLONG` — the one
   deliberate exception to "RFC 1459/2812 only," included because it's a
   widely-adopted de facto standard filling an otherwise-unused numeric
   gap in the RFC's own numbering (415→421), purpose-built for exactly
   the line-length limit this project's `message-tags` support requires
   (FR-049) — the same category of justified addition IRCv3's `CAP`
   numerics already are. `jircd-protocol`'s `NumericReply` model MUST
   represent all of these, for the same reason its command model covers
   the full command set: a future client library needs to parse
   `312 RPL_WHOISSERVER` from *any* server, not only one that happens to
   implement the server-name part of `WHOIS`.
2. **Server behavior** (`jircd-core` and extensions) — only the numerics
   marked **Used** below are actually sent by this release. Every other
   numeric in the full catalog is defined (correct code, correct name,
   parseable/serializable) but never emitted by this server, because
   nothing in this release triggers it (its command is "Recognized only"
   per irc-protocol-commands.md, or the feature behind it doesn't exist
   yet).

Error replies MUST be worded specifically enough to satisfy
FR-002/FR-012/FR-014/FR-015's "clear error" requirements (constitution
Principle III: error messages state what went wrong and what the
client/administrator can do about it).

Every numeric reply's target field is the receiving session's current
nickname — except before one has been claimed, when it MUST be `*`
(FR-053, irc-protocol-commands.md "Connection Registration") — this
applies to `431`/`432`/`433` below, the numerics most likely to fire
during that window.

## Used in This Release

| Numeric | Name | Triggered by | FR |
|---|---|---|---|
| `001` | `RPL_WELCOME` | Successful registration — Registration Completion Burst (irc-protocol-commands.md "Connection Registration") | FR-001, FR-051 |
| `002` | `RPL_YOURHOST` | Registration Completion Burst | FR-050, FR-051 |
| `003` | `RPL_CREATED` | Registration Completion Burst | FR-051 |
| `004` | `RPL_MYINFO` | Registration Completion Burst | FR-043, FR-044, FR-050, FR-051 |
| `005` | `RPL_ISUPPORT` | Registration Completion Burst — one or more lines (data-model.md `SupportedFeatures`); de facto meaning, not RFC 2812's `RPL_BOUNCE` | FR-051, FR-055 |
| `422` | `ERR_NOMOTD` | Registration Completion Burst (this release implements no MOTD content) | FR-051 |
| `322` | `RPL_LIST` | `LIST` (one per active channel) | FR-042 |
| `323` | `RPL_LISTEND` | End of a `LIST` reply | FR-042 |
| `331` | `RPL_NOTOPIC` | `TOPIC` query on a channel with no topic set | FR-040 |
| `332` | `RPL_TOPIC` | `TOPIC` query on a channel with a topic set | FR-040 |
| `311` | `RPL_WHOISUSER` | Successful `WHOIS` | FR-037, FR-038 |
| `318` | `RPL_ENDOFWHOIS` | End of a `WHOIS` reply | FR-037 |
| `353` | `RPL_NAMREPLY` | `JOIN`, `NAMES` — nicknames prefixed `@` (operator) or `+` (voiced, non-operator) per irc-protocol-commands.md "Channel Operations" | FR-003, FR-041, FR-045, FR-046 |
| `366` | `RPL_ENDOFNAMES` | `JOIN`, `NAMES` | FR-003, FR-041 |
| `381` | `RPL_YOUREOPER` | Successful `OPER` | FR-034 |
| `382` | `RPL_REHASHING` | Successful `REHASH` | FR-011, FR-012 (research.md "Configuration reload mechanism") |
| `401` | `ERR_NOSUCHNICK` | `WHOIS` for a nickname that isn't connected | FR-037 |
| `403` | `ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL` | `TOPIC`/`NAMES` for a channel that doesn't exist, or that is private/secret and the requester is neither a member nor an administrator (identical response either way, FR-047) | FR-047 |
| `417` | `ERR_INPUTTOOLONG` | A line exceeding the 512-byte base limit or the 4096-byte `message-tags` allowance (FR-049) — not part of RFC 1459/2812 (there is no numeric defined in that gap, 416-420), but a widely-adopted de facto standard purpose-built for exactly this case, the same way this project already treats IRCv3's `CAP` numerics as belonging alongside the RFC set | FR-049 |
| `421` | `ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND` | Malformed/unrecognized command, a wire-protocol-recognized command with no handler in this release, or a human-readable-content parameter (`PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE` body, topic, realname, channel name) containing invalid UTF-8 (FR-054) | FR-015, FR-054 |
| `431` | `ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN` | `NICK` with no argument | FR-001 (input validation) |
| `432` | `ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME` | `NICK` violating the nickname grammar (invalid leading/body characters or over 9 characters) | irc-protocol-commands.md "Connection Registration Grammar" |
| `433` | `ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE` | `NICK` naming an already-claimed nickname | FR-002 |
| `441` | `ERR_USERNOTINCHANNEL` | `MODE +v`/`-v` or `+o`/`-o <nickname>` naming a nickname that isn't a current member of the target channel | FR-045, FR-046 |
| `442` | `ERR_NOTONCHANNEL` | `PART`/`KICK`/`MODE` on a channel the sender hasn't joined; `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE` to a channel with `members-only` active that the sender hasn't joined (FR-004, FR-013/FR-043 — membership is not required for `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE` otherwise) | FR-003, FR-004, FR-014 |
| `476` | `ERR_BADCHANMASK` | `JOIN` naming a channel that violates the Channel Name Grammar (irc-protocol-commands.md "Channel Operations") | FR-048 |
| `461` | `ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS` | Command missing required parameters | FR-015 |
| `464` | `ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH` | Failed `OPER` (also logged as a security event, FR-019) | FR-034 |
| `472` | `ERR_UNKNOWNMODE` | `MODE` given a flag the core moderation command set doesn't define | FR-015, FR-036 (core input validation — `MODE` is never extension-gated) |
| `481` | `ERR_NOPRIVILEGES` | `EXTENSION`/`WHOHOST`/`REHASH` (or any admin command) attempted without administrator privilege | FR-033 |
| `482` | `ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED` | `KICK`/`MODE` attempted by a non-operator | FR-014 |
| `CAP * LS` | (IRCv3, not a numeric) | `CAP LS` | FR-006 |
| `CAP * ACK` / `CAP * NAK` | (IRCv3) | `CAP REQ` | FR-007 |

## Full Numeric Catalog (`jircd-protocol` — Wire-Protocol Recognition)

Every reply/error numeric RFC 1459/2812 defines. Entries not listed above
under "Used in This Release" are **Reserved** — defined in the catalog,
never sent by this server this release (the command or feature that would
trigger them is "Recognized only" per irc-protocol-commands.md).

**Contract notes**:
- Every error reply's trailing `:<text>` parameter MUST name the specific
  problem (e.g., "Nickname is already in use" for `433`, not a generic
  "Error") — this is the testable form of FR-002/FR-012/FR-014/FR-015's
  "clear error" requirement and of the constitution's UX Consistency
  principle. This applies to every numeric in the "Used" set; Reserved
  numerics have no wording to get right yet since this server never sends
  them.
- Reply wording for a given numeric MUST be identical regardless of which
  subsystem produced it. `482` is now always sourced from core channel
  moderation (FR-036) rather than an extension, so this mainly applies to
  `481`: it MUST read the same whether it was triggered by the core admin
  command set or by a future `jircd-server-extensions/*` extension that
  also gates an action on administrator privilege — satisfying
  FR-011/FR-020's extension-consistency intent at the protocol level.
- Moving a Reserved numeric to Used is a `jircd-core`/extension change
  (implementing the feature/command that triggers it), not a
  `jircd-protocol` change — the numeric is already correctly modeled.
- `005` is used for its de facto `RPL_ISUPPORT` meaning (FR-055,
  research.md "ISUPPORT / RPL_ISUPPORT"), not RFC 2812's original
  `RPL_BOUNCE` — the `RPL_BOUNCE` name in the catalog reflects the RFC's
  own naming for historical/parsing-completeness purposes, but this
  server never emits it with that meaning. This resolves the deferral
  an earlier version of this note carried ("revisit if a future
  capability needs to advertise server limits/features this way") —
  FR-054's UTF-8 enforcement was exactly that trigger.
