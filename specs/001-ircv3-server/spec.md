# Feature Specification: Modular IRCv3 Chat Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-ircv3-server`

**Created**: 2026-08-15

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Build a modular IRCv3 server in Java with the latest capabilities"

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-08-15

- Q: Should this be a single standalone server, or must multiple server instances be able to link together into one federated network? → A: Start standalone; architecture must support adding server-to-server federation as a later, independently addable module without a core redesign.
- Q: Should the server own and manage user accounts and channel-registration/ownership records itself, or should it only verify identities against an external, separately operated account system? → A: Identity verification MUST support external account systems (pluggable), AND the initial release MUST ship a basic, built-in account module (its own minimal account store) as the default pluggable implementation.
- Q: Which specific IRCv3 capabilities must the server support in its initial release? → A: Minimal core set only — `message-tags` (structured metadata on messages), `server-time` (accurate timestamps), and `echo-message` (delivery confirmation of a client's own sent messages). Broader capabilities (SASL beyond the minimum needed for Story 3, account-notify, away-notify, batch, chathistory, etc.) are deferred to a later iteration.
- Q: Is authentication (Story 3) mandatory for all connections, and what identity-uniqueness rules are non-negotiable? → A: Authentication remains optional per-connection at initial release — unauthenticated clients continue to be served under standard IRC behavior. What is non-negotiable, per core IRC protocol requirements, is that nicknames and channel names are each a single, server-wide unique namespace: a nickname or channel name identifies exactly one client/channel at a time, with no duplicates permitted regardless of authentication status.
- Q: Must every client connection be encrypted in transit? → A: No — encryption is not part of the core IRC protocol. The server MUST offer an encrypted (TLS) connection option, but MUST also continue to accept unencrypted connections; encryption is a per-connection/administrator choice, not a mandatory requirement for all clients.
- Q: Does "modular" require that modules can be loaded and unloaded while the server keeps running, or is a restart acceptable to apply a module change? → A: Modules MUST be enable/disable-able by an administrator, and that change MUST take effect without restarting the running server process — no restart or reload interruption is acceptable for a module state change.
- Q: When two clients attempt to claim the same nickname at nearly the same instant, how must the server resolve the race? → A: First-registration-wins: the server MUST treat nickname claims atomically against its live state, so whichever request it commits first holds the nickname, and every other concurrent or later request for that same name is rejected with the standard "nickname in use" error (FR-002) — consistent with RFC 2812's ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE (433), which the original IRC protocol defines for exactly this case.
- Q: How is channel-operator status determined, and how does that interact with the account module? → A: By default (classic IRC behavior), the first client to join a channel becomes its operator. When the account module (FR-023/FR-024) is enabled, a channel MAY instead be registered/owned by an account and a nickname MAY be registered to an account (NickServ/ChanServ-style, used here as the familiar reference pattern, not a mandated command set); wherever such registration exists, it takes priority over the classic first-join rule — a registered channel's operator authority comes from its account-system ownership/access records, and by default an unauthenticated or wrongly-authenticated client MUST NOT be able to claim a nickname already registered to another account (administrator-configurable to allow).
- Q: Is User Story 3 (authentication) mandatory for the first iteration? → A: No — Story 3 is deferred to a later release. The first iteration MUST be fully usable via Stories 1, 2, and 4 alone. All requirements that exist solely to support Story 3 (FR-009, FR-010, FR-023, FR-024, FR-026, FR-027) and its success criterion (SC-007) are deferred with it; the classic first-join-gets-operator rule (FR-013) is the only channel-operator behavior in effect until the account module is later built.
- Q: Does treating federation as "just another module" (like Story 4's capabilities/moderation-tool modules) correctly capture what a future server-to-server implementation would need? → A: No — that framing was reconsidered as an oversimplification. Federation introduces a server-to-server trust boundary and distributed state (network-wide identity uniqueness, cross-server message routing, netsplit handling) that a client-facing module does not; it is not required to fit the FR-011 module abstraction, and its actual extension mechanism is left as a planning-phase decision made when federation is scoped. What this specification commits to now instead is narrower and testable: FR-021 (standalone operation, federation out of initial scope) plus FR-022, which names the specific core behaviors — nickname/channel uniqueness scope, channel message delivery, connection-loss handling — that MUST be implemented in a way that doesn't foreclose extending them later.
- Q: Once federation exists, must every linked server run the same active modules, and must authentication stay consistent network-wide? → A: Yes to both. When federation is introduced, linked servers MUST present a consistent set of active modules to clients network-wide — a client's experience must not depend on which linked server it connects to (FR-028). Where the account module is in use in a federated network, account/identity verification and registration records MUST be managed by a single authoritative source shared across all linked servers, not independently per-instance (FR-029). Neither constraint requires anything of the initial, standalone release; they bound how a future federation effort must behave.

### Session 2026-08-16

- Q: Must a client already be a member of a channel to send it a PRIVMSG/NOTICE, or can any registered client message a channel it hasn't joined unless members-only mode is explicitly set? → A: Membership is NOT required by default — any registered client can PRIVMSG/NOTICE a channel it hasn't joined; members-only (FR-013/FR-043) is what restricts this.
- Q: What should the wire-protocol validation rules be for a channel name? → A: RFC 2812 channel grammar — a leading `#` (standard channel type only, no `&`/`+`/`!` variants) followed by 1 to 49 additional characters, excluding space, comma, and control characters (50 characters total, maximum) — the same rigor already applied to nickname format (contracts/irc-protocol-commands.md "Connection Registration Grammar"), rejected with a dedicated error distinct from "nickname in use"-style errors.
- Q: What should happen when the server is at capacity and a new client tries to connect? → A: No explicit server-level limit — the server does not enforce its own connection cap or send a dedicated rejection message; capacity is bounded only by OS/network resources and whatever an administrator configures at the deployment layer. SC-003's 1,000-connection floor is a sustained-operation target, not a hard ceiling with special in-protocol handling.
- Q: Should the server enforce a maximum protocol line length, and how should an over-length message be handled? → A: 512-byte base line limit (command+params, CRLF-inclusive, classic IRC), plus the IRCv3 message-tags specification's required server-side allowance of up to 4096 additional bytes for the tags section (since FR-025 already implements message-tags). A line exceeding either budget MUST be rejected under FR-015's existing malformed-message handling, not silently truncated.
- Q: Should the server enforce/assume a specific character encoding for message text, or treat it as an opaque byte stream? → A: UTF-8, validated — message text (`PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE` bodies, topics, realnames, and channel names) MUST be valid UTF-8; the server MUST reject a message containing an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence in one of these fields as malformed (FR-015), not pass it through, mistranscode it, or silently discard just the invalid portion.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Connect and Chat in Real Time (Priority: P1)

A person using any standard IRC client connects to the server, registers a
nickname, joins a channel, and exchanges messages with other people
connected to that channel in real time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core reason the server exists — without
reliable connection, registration, and message delivery, nothing else
matters. It is the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Connect two separate IRC clients to the server,
register distinct nicknames, join the same channel, and confirm each
client sees messages sent by the other within a second.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is running and reachable, **When** a client
   connects and sends valid registration commands (nickname and user
   info), **Then** the server confirms registration and the client is
   recognized as an active user.
2. **Given** two registered clients have joined the same channel, **When**
   one sends a message to the channel, **Then** the other receives the
   message attributed to the correct sender.
3. **Given** a client attempts to register with a nickname already in use
   by another connected client, **When** the registration is submitted,
   **Then** the server rejects it with a clear "nickname in use" response
   and the client can retry with a different nickname.
4. **Given** a channel operator sets a topic on their channel, **When**
   another member views the channel, **Then** they see the current topic;
   **When** a non-operator member attempts to change it, **Then** the
   server rejects the attempt with a clear permissions error.
5. **Given** several channels currently have members, **When** a client
   requests the list of active channels, or the member list of one of
   them, **Then** the server returns accurate, current results without
   requiring the requesting client to have joined that channel first.

---

### User Story 2 - Discover and Use Enhanced Capabilities (Priority: P2)

A person using a modern IRC client that supports capability negotiation
connects to the server, discovers which enhanced protocol capabilities are
available, and enables the ones its client supports so it can display
richer information (such as message timestamps and delivery
confirmations) without breaking clients that do not support them.

**Why this priority**: Capability negotiation is what distinguishes an
"IRCv3" server from a legacy IRC server — it is the mechanism that lets
the server offer modern features while remaining backward compatible with
older clients, so it is core to the product's identity but depends on
basic connectivity (Story 1) already working.

**Independent Test**: Connect a capability-aware test client, request the
list of available capabilities, negotiate a subset, and confirm the
server's subsequent messages include the negotiated enhancements (e.g., a
timestamp on each message) while a plain client connected at the same time
sees standard, unaugmented messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client connects and requests the capability list before
   registering, **When** the server responds, **Then** the client receives
   a complete, accurate list of capabilities currently available.
2. **Given** a client requests a specific supported capability, **When**
   the request is processed, **Then** the server acknowledges it and
   begins including that capability's enhancements in relevant messages
   for that client's session.
3. **Given** a client requests a capability the server does not support,
   **When** the request is processed, **Then** the server clearly declines
   that specific capability without breaking the rest of the negotiation
   or disconnecting the client.

---

### User Story 3 - Authenticate to Protect an Identity (Priority: P3, Deferred)

A person with a registered account authenticates during connection so that
other users and the server can trust their claimed identity, preventing
someone else from impersonating them by using the same nickname.

**Why this priority**: Identity trust becomes important once a community
has recurring members and protected nicknames/channels, but a server can
deliver value (Stories 1–2) before this is required — so it follows
core chat and capability negotiation in priority. **This story is not
mandatory for the first iteration**: the server MUST be fully usable
(Stories 1–2, and Story 4's extensibility) without it, and it is deferred
to a later release. It is documented now so the boundary it requires (the
account module) can be designed for without committing to build it yet.

**Independent Test**: Attempt to authenticate a client with valid account
credentials and confirm the session is marked as authenticated to other
clients; attempt authentication with invalid credentials and confirm it is
rejected with a clear error and the connection is not marked as
authenticated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client provides valid account credentials during
   authentication, **When** the server verifies them, **Then** the session
   is marked authenticated and the client's verified identity is visible
   to other clients that request it.
2. **Given** a client provides invalid credentials, **When** the server
   attempts verification, **Then** the server rejects the attempt with a
   clear error and does not mark the session as authenticated.
3. **Given** an authenticated client disconnects, **When** it reconnects
   with the same credentials, **Then** it is able to re-authenticate and
   regain its verified status.

---

### User Story 4 - Tailor the Server with Optional Extensions (Priority: P4)

A server administrator enables, disables, and configures optional
extensions (for example, individual IRCv3 capabilities such as
`message-tags` or `server-time`) to match their community's needs, without
needing to modify the server's core codebase. Core protocol behavior —
including channel moderation and the capability-negotiation mechanism
itself — is always present and is not part of what this story's toggling
applies to (see FR-035, FR-036).

**Why this priority**: Extensibility is a stated goal of the product and
matters most to administrators, but the server delivers its primary value
to end users (chatting) even with a fixed default set of extensions
enabled — so administrator-facing configurability is valuable but not
blocking for the core chat experience.

**Independent Test**: As an administrator, disable an optional extension
via configuration while the server keeps running (no restart), and confirm
connected clients can no longer use that extension's functionality while
all other functionality continues to work uninterrupted; re-enable it the
same way and confirm functionality returns without a restart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the administrator has a list of optional extensions, **When**
   they disable one via configuration while the server is running, **Then**
   the server no longer offers or accepts requests for that extension's
   functionality, without the server process being restarted.
2. **Given** an extension is disabled, **When** the administrator
   re-enables it via configuration while the server is running, **Then**
   its functionality becomes available again without requiring changes
   beyond configuration and without restarting the server process.
3. **Given** an administrator provides an invalid extension configuration,
   **When** the server loads its configuration, **Then** the server
   reports a clear configuration error identifying the problem instead of
   starting in a broken or partially-configured state.

---

### User Story 5 - Moderate a Channel (Priority: P5)

A channel operator manages who can participate in their channel and how,
using standard moderation actions (such as removing a disruptive user or
restricting who may speak) to keep the community usable.

**Why this priority**: Moderation matters once channels have active,
larger communities, but small or trusted communities can function
initially without it — it rounds out the product rather than gating its
core value.

**Independent Test**: As a channel operator, remove a user from a channel
and confirm they are no longer a member and are notified of the removal;
confirm other channel members see the removal reflected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is a channel operator, **When** they remove another
   member from the channel, **Then** that member is no longer part of the
   channel and all remaining members are notified of the removal.
2. **Given** a user is not a channel operator, **When** they attempt a
   moderation action, **Then** the server rejects the action with a clear
   permissions error.
3. **Given** an operator restricts who may send messages to a channel,
   **When** a non-permitted member attempts to send a message, **Then**
   the message is not delivered and the sender receives a clear
   explanation.
4. **Given** a channel is under moderated-mode restriction (Scenario 3)
   and an operator grants a member the voice privilege, **When** that
   voiced member sends a message, **Then** it is delivered — unlike a
   non-voiced, non-operator member's message under the same restriction.
5. **Given** an operator grants operator status to another member,
   **When** that member performs a moderation action (e.g., removing a
   disruptive user), **Then** it succeeds, the same as if the original
   operator had performed it.
6. **Given** an operator marks their channel secret, **When** a
   non-member requests its topic, membership list, or checks the active
   channel list, **Then** the response is indistinguishable from the
   channel not existing; **When** a current member does the same,
   **Then** they see it normally.

---

### User Story 6 - Administer the Server via IRC Commands (Priority: P4)

An administrator, connected as an ordinary IRC client, grants themselves
administrator privilege via an in-band command and then issues
administrative commands — such as enabling or disabling an optional
extension, looking up a client's real hostname, forcing their way into a
channel a regular client couldn't join, or granting themselves channel-
operator status without waiting on an existing operator — directly
through the IRC protocol, without needing file system or configuration-
file access to the server host.

**Why this priority**: In-band administration is a peer capability to
Story 4's configuration-file path, not a lesser one — administering a
server that requires host/file access for every change is not practically
usable, so this shares Story 4's priority tier.

**Independent Test**: Connect as a normal client, issue the
privilege-granting command with valid administrator credentials, confirm
privilege is granted, then issue an extension-toggle administrative
command and confirm the extension's state change takes effect for other
connected clients — all without touching the configuration file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a connected, registered client, **When** it issues the
   administrator-privilege command with valid credentials, **Then** the
   server grants administrator privilege to that session and confirms it.
2. **Given** a session without administrator privilege, **When** it
   attempts an administrative command, **Then** the server rejects it with
   a clear permissions error and takes no action.
3. **Given** a session holding administrator privilege, **When** it issues
   a command to disable an enabled extension, **Then** the extension
   becomes unavailable to all clients without a server restart — the same
   observable effect as a configuration-file-driven change (FR-011).
4. **Given** a session holding administrator privilege, **When** it
   requests a specific client's real hostname, **Then** the server returns
   the real, unobfuscated value even if a cloaking extension currently
   obscures that client's hostname from other clients (FR-031).
5. **Given** a session holding administrator privilege, **When** it issues
   the force-join command against a channel that a currently-active
   channel-mode flag would otherwise block a regular client from joining,
   **Then** the server joins that session to the channel anyway; **When**
   that same session, now a member of a channel that already has other
   members and an existing operator, issues the self-op command, **Then**
   the server grants it channel-operator status immediately, without
   requiring an existing operator to grant it (FR-057, FR-058).

---

### User Story 7 - Look Up Information About a User (Priority: P2)

A person using an IRC client looks up information about themselves or
about another connected user — nickname, ident, presented hostname, and
real name — the same kind of lookup virtually every IRC client performs
routinely.

**Why this priority**: This is standard, expected IRC functionality (like
Story 2's capability negotiation, it rounds out what makes the server feel
like a complete IRC server) but the server already delivers its core value
(chatting) without it, so it isn't blocking for the MVP.

**Independent Test**: As a connected client, look up your own information
and confirm it's returned correctly; as a different, non-administrator
client, look up that same user's information and confirm you receive
their presented (not real) hostname.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a connected, registered client, **When** it looks up
   information about itself (no target, or its own nickname), **Then**
   the server returns that client's own real, unobfuscated hostname/IP —
   regardless of whether a cloaking extension is currently enabled — along
   with its nickname, ident, and real name.
2. **Given** a session holding administrator privilege, **When** it looks
   up information about a different connected client, **Then** the server
   returns that client's real, unobfuscated hostname/IP, consistent with
   FR-032's administrator visibility guarantee.
3. **Given** a session that does **not** hold administrator privilege,
   **When** it looks up information about a *different* connected client,
   **Then** the server returns only that client's presented hostname (the
   same value it would see in that client's message hostmask — obfuscated
   if a cloaking extension is enabled, the real value otherwise) — never
   that client's real, unobfuscated hostname/IP.
4. **Given** a client looks up a nickname that is not currently connected,
   **When** the lookup is processed, **Then** the server returns a clear
   "no such nickname" error rather than any user data.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a client attempts to register with a nickname or
  username that violates protocol formatting rules (invalid characters,
  excessive length)?
- What does a client actually receive once registration succeeds, beyond
  a bare "you're welcome here" — and what happens if the administrator
  never configured a server name at all, or the deployment host's own
  hostname doesn't contain a "." either?
- If a future server extension contributing enough additional
  channel-mode flags (FR-043) made the feature-support advertisement
  (FR-055) too long for one line, does the server split it across
  multiple lines the way real IRC servers do, or truncate/fail?
- What happens when a client registers "Alice," disconnects, and a
  different client then tries to register "alice" — does the server
  treat these as the same nickname (rejecting the second) or two
  different ones?
- How does the server handle a client that sends messages faster than an
  acceptable rate (flooding), whether accidental or malicious?
- What happens when a client disconnects abruptly (no clean quit) while
  still a member of one or more channels?
- What happens when a client's connection goes silent without *any*
  TCP-level signal at all — no clean quit, no abrupt-close error, just a
  network path that stopped delivering data (e.g., the client's machine
  lost power, or a NAT/firewall silently dropped an idle connection) — how
  does the server ever notice and clean it up?
- How does the server respond to a malformed or incomplete protocol
  message that cannot be parsed?
- What happens when a client sends a channel mode flag other than the two
  this release implements (moderated-mode, members-only) — e.g.,
  invite-only or a channel key — or queries a channel's current modes
  with no flag argument at all? What happens when a client sends a
  user-level mode change or query, which this release doesn't implement
  at all?
- How does the server behave when an optional extension fails to start or
  encounters an internal error while running — does the rest of the
  server continue operating?
- *(Applies once a mode-contributing extension exists — no extension
  contributes one in this release)* What happens to a channel that
  already has an extension-contributed mode flag set when the
  administrator disables that extension — does the flag disappear, does
  it linger inertly, or something else?
- What happens to a member's voice privilege (FR-045) when they leave a
  channel and rejoin — do they keep it, or does an operator need to grant
  it again?
- What happens if every operator of a channel revokes their own operator
  status (or leaves) without first granting it to anyone else (FR-046) —
  does the server automatically promote a remaining member, or can an
  existing channel end up with members but no operator at all?
- What happens if an operator marks a channel both private and secret at
  once — does one silently override the other, or is it rejected as
  contradictory (FR-047)?
- Can an administrator investigating abuse still see a private/secret
  channel's topic and membership, the same way they can already see a
  cloaked member's real hostname (FR-032), or is that visibility
  guarantee limited to identity information (FR-047)?
- What happens when a client negotiates a capability, and mid-session the
  administrator disables the extension providing that capability?
- How does the server respond when a channel or nickname name exceeds
  defined length or character constraints?
- What happens when the maximum number of concurrent connections is
  reached and a new client attempts to connect?
- What happens when a client issues the administrator-privilege command
  (FR-034) with invalid credentials — is the attempt logged as a
  security-relevant event (FR-019), and is the client disconnected or just
  refused privilege?
- What happens to already-cloaked clients' presented hostnames when the
  cloaking extension is disabled while they remain connected — is cloaking
  removed immediately, or does it persist for that session until
  reconnect?
- What does a client see when it looks itself up while a cloaking
  extension is obscuring its own hostname from everyone else — its real
  value (since it's the client's own data) or the same obscured value
  other clients see?
- *(Applies once Story 3 / the account module is implemented — not
  applicable to the initial release)* How does the server handle an
  authenticated client's underlying account being deleted or suspended
  mid-session?
- *(Applies once Story 3 / the account module is implemented — not
  applicable to the initial release)* What happens when an unregistered
  channel already has a first-join operator, and a member later registers
  ownership of that channel to an account — does the account's authority
  immediately supersede the existing operator (per FR-026), and how are
  current members notified?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The server MUST accept incoming client connections and allow
  a client to register a unique nickname and associated user information
  before participating in chat. The command that supplies that user
  information (`USER`) is strictly one-shot per connection: it MUST be
  rejected with a clear, specific error — distinct from FR-015's other
  malformed-message cases — if a session that has already processed one
  `USER` command sends a second, whether the repeat arrives before or
  after registration completes. Re-sending it MUST NOT re-trigger the
  registration-completion burst, alter the session's already-established
  `ident`/real name, or otherwise be silently accepted as a no-op;
  `NICK` is unaffected by this restriction and remains usable at any
  time to change an already-registered session's nickname (FR-002).
- **FR-002**: The server MUST reject registration attempts that use a
  nickname currently claimed by another connected client, and MUST inform
  the requesting client clearly. Nickname claims MUST be resolved
  atomically against the server's live state: when multiple clients
  request the same nickname concurrently, exactly one MUST succeed (the
  one the server commits first) and every other request for that name —
  concurrent or later — MUST be rejected with the same "nickname in use"
  error, with no window in which two clients both hold the name. This
  uniqueness check is case-insensitive (FR-052) — "Alice" and "alice"
  are the same nickname, not two different ones.
- **FR-003**: The server MUST allow registered clients to create or join
  named channels and to leave channels they have joined. Channel names
  MUST form a single, server-wide unique namespace: a given channel name
  identifies exactly one channel at a time, so joining a name that
  already exists MUST add the client to that existing channel rather than
  creating a separate, duplicate one. This uniqueness check is
  case-insensitive (FR-052) — "#Foo" and "#foo" are the same channel.
- **FR-004**: The server MUST deliver messages sent to a channel to every
  other client currently joined to that channel, attributed to the correct
  sender. Sending a channel message MUST NOT itself require the sender to
  be a member of that channel — membership is a precondition only when
  the channel's members-only restriction (FR-013/FR-043) is active; by
  default (members-only unset), any registered client MAY send to any
  channel it hasn't joined, and delivery still reaches only the
  channel's current membership as stated above.
- **FR-005**: The server MUST support direct, private messaging between
  two registered clients without requiring a shared channel.
- **FR-006**: The server MUST support capability negotiation, allowing a
  connecting client to request the list of capabilities the server
  currently offers before completing registration.
- **FR-007**: The server MUST allow a client to request one or more
  specific capabilities and MUST respond indicating which were accepted
  and which were declined.
- **FR-008**: The server MUST continue to support clients that do not
  perform capability negotiation at all, providing them standard,
  unaugmented protocol behavior.
- **FR-009** *(Deferred — not required for initial release; supports
  Story 3)*: The server MUST support verifying a client's claimed account
  identity during connection registration via an authentication exchange,
  and MUST reflect authenticated status to other clients that request it.
  Authentication MUST remain optional per-connection whenever it is
  implemented: a client that does not authenticate MUST still be able to
  register a nickname and use standard chat functionality under core IRC
  behavior.
- **FR-010** *(Deferred — not required for initial release; supports
  Story 3)*: The server MUST reject invalid authentication attempts with
  a clear error and MUST NOT mark a session as authenticated when
  verification fails.
- **FR-011**: The server MUST allow an administrator to enable or disable
  individual optional extensions via configuration, without requiring
  changes to the server's core codebase, and without requiring the running
  server process to be restarted for the change to take effect.
- **FR-012**: The server MUST report a clear, specific error when an
  administrator's configuration is invalid, rather than silently ignoring
  the problem or starting in an inconsistent state.
- **FR-013**: The server MUST support designated channel operators
  performing standard moderation actions, including removing a member from
  a channel and restricting who may send messages to it. By default, a
  channel's first operator MUST be the client whose join created that
  channel (classic first-join-gets-operator behavior). FR-026 and FR-027
  define how this default is later superseded once the (currently
  deferred) account module manages the channel or nickname involved; for
  the initial release, the classic default is the only behavior in
  effect.
- **FR-014**: The server MUST reject moderation actions attempted by
  clients who do not hold the required channel privileges, with a clear
  permissions error.
- **FR-015**: The server MUST detect and reject malformed protocol
  messages without crashing or disconnecting unrelated clients. Command
  recognition MUST be case-insensitive — `join`, `Join`, and `JOIN` MUST
  all match the same command — the same way `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE`/`JOIN`
  etc. are documented throughout this specification in a single
  canonical case only for readability, not to imply that case is
  significant on the wire.
- **FR-016**: The server MUST limit the rate of messages or commands
  accepted from a single connection to protect overall service
  availability for other clients.
- **FR-017**: The server MUST clean up a client's channel memberships and
  notify affected channels when that client disconnects, whether
  gracefully or unexpectedly.
- **FR-018**: The server MUST offer clients the option to connect over an
  encrypted (TLS) connection, and MUST also continue to accept
  unencrypted connections. Encryption is a per-connection choice made by
  the client (or an administrator-configured policy for a given
  deployment), not a mandatory requirement of the protocol itself.
- **FR-019**: The server MUST log security-relevant events (including
  failed authentication attempts and rejected moderation actions) in a
  form an administrator can review.
- **FR-020**: The server MUST continue serving unaffected clients when a
  single optional extension fails to start or encounters a runtime error.
- **FR-021**: The server MUST operate as a complete, self-sufficient
  standalone deployment — a single instance MUST NOT require any other
  server instance to be present to serve clients. Server-to-server
  federation (linking multiple instances into one network experienced by
  end users as a single chat network) is out of scope for the initial
  release. The core design MUST NOT foreclose adding federation in a
  later release, but this specification does NOT require federation to
  fit the same independent-extension abstraction used for individual
  capabilities and command sets (FR-011): federation introduces a
  server-to-server trust boundary and distributed state that a
  client-facing extension does not, so it may need its own extension
  mechanism, to be defined when federation is actually planned rather
  than assumed now.
- **FR-022**: To keep a future federation effort viable without a full
  redesign, the initial release's implementation of the following
  client-facing behaviors MUST be treated as later-extensible rather than
  hard-assumed to be server-local: nickname and channel uniqueness
  scope (FR-002, FR-003 — "unique on this server" today, potentially
  "unique across the network" later), message delivery to a channel's
  membership (FR-004 — membership may later span servers), and
  connection-loss cleanup and notification (FR-017 — a "disconnect" may
  later originate from a peer server rather than the client). No
  federation behavior itself is required for the initial release; this
  requirement only constrains how the in-scope behaviors above are
  implemented so they remain compatible with a later change.
- **FR-023** *(Deferred — not required for initial release; supports
  Story 3)*: The server MUST verify account identities through a
  pluggable account-verification interface, allowing an administrator to
  configure it against an external, separately operated account system
  instead of (or in addition to) the server's own account store.
- **FR-024** *(Deferred — not required for initial release; supports
  Story 3)*: The server MUST ship with a basic, built-in account module —
  a minimal account store covering account creation and credential
  verification — enabled by default, so the server is usable for
  authentication (Story 3) without requiring an external account system
  to be deployed first. Whenever this module is implemented, it MUST
  store credentials securely: credentials MUST NOT be persisted in plain
  text, and MUST be protected using an industry-standard, purpose-built
  method for the credential type (e.g., a salted, computationally-expensive
  hash for passwords) such that recovering the original credential from
  stored data alone is infeasible.
- **FR-025**: The server MUST offer the following enhanced capabilities in
  its initial release: structured message metadata (`message-tags`),
  accurate message timestamps (`server-time`), and delivery confirmation
  of a client's own sent messages (`echo-message`). The authentication
  capability needed to support Story 3 is deferred along with that story
  (see FR-023). Other enhanced capabilities (e.g., presence/away status,
  multi-device account awareness, batched message delivery, chat history
  replay) are likewise out of scope for initial release and deferred to a
  later iteration.
- **FR-026** *(Deferred — not required for initial release; depends on
  the account module, FR-023/FR-024)*: When the account module is
  enabled, an account MUST be able to register ownership of a channel.
  Where a channel is registered, its operator/privilege assignments MUST
  be derived from that account's stored access records rather than from
  join order, and this registered-ownership authority MUST take priority
  over the classic first-join-gets-operator default (FR-013) whenever the
  two would conflict — for example, an authenticated owner joining a
  registered channel after others are already present MUST still receive
  its operator authority. Until the account module is implemented, every
  channel's operator status follows the classic default only.
- **FR-027** *(Deferred — not required for initial release; depends on
  the account module, FR-023/FR-024)*: When the account module is
  enabled, an account MUST be able to register ownership of a nickname.
  By default, the server MUST reject an attempt by an unauthenticated
  client, or a client authenticated to a different account, to claim a
  nickname already registered to another account. An administrator MUST
  be able to configure the server to allow this instead (e.g., permitting
  the claim with a warning rather than a rejection).
- **FR-028** *(Deferred — constrains a future federation effort; not
  applicable to the initial, standalone release)*: Once federation
  (FR-021) is introduced, every server linked into the same network MUST
  present a consistent set of active extensions to clients — an optional
  capability or other extension enabled on one linked server MUST be
  enabled (or consistently unavailable) network-wide, so a client's
  experience does not depend on which linked server it happens to be
  connected to.
- **FR-029** *(Deferred — constrains a future federation effort; not
  applicable to the initial, standalone release)*: Once federation
  (FR-021) is introduced and the account module (FR-023/FR-024) is in
  use, account verification and account/nickname/channel registration
  records MUST be managed by a single authoritative source shared across
  every linked server in the network. No linked server instance may
  operate its own independent, potentially divergent account store.
- **FR-030**: The server MUST present each client's identity, on protocol
  messages that include a sender (e.g., channel and direct messages, join/
  part/quit notifications), in the standard `nickname!ident@hostname` form,
  where `ident` and `hostname` are derived from the client's connection.
- **FR-031**: The server MUST support an optional extension that replaces
  the hostname/IP portion of a client's presented identity (FR-030) with an
  obfuscated value shown to other clients, while the server continues to
  record that client's real, unobfuscated hostname/IP internally.
  Administrators MUST be able to view a client's real hostname/IP at any
  time regardless of whether cloaking is currently applied to it (see
  FR-032).
- **FR-032**: The server MUST provide an in-band administrative command
  interface, available over the IRC protocol itself, through which an
  authorized administrator can perform administrative actions — at
  minimum, enabling/disabling optional extensions (FR-011) and viewing a
  client's real, unobfuscated hostname/IP (FR-031) — without requiring
  direct access to the server's configuration file or host filesystem.
- **FR-033**: The server MUST restrict administrative commands (FR-032) to
  sessions holding administrator privilege, and MUST reject attempts from
  any other session with a clear permissions error — mirroring the
  channel-operator privilege pattern (FR-014), but as a distinct,
  server-wide privilege independent of channel-operator status.
- **FR-034**: The server MUST support granting administrator privilege to
  an already-registered session via an in-band credential-verification
  command (classic IRC OPER-style), checked against administrator
  credentials defined in the Server Configuration. This mechanism MUST be
  independent of the deferred account module (FR-023/FR-024), since
  administrative access must not depend on functionality that is out of
  scope for the initial release. Administrator credentials stored in the
  Server Configuration MUST be protected the same way as FR-024 requires
  for the account module (not plain text; industry-standard hashing). A
  successful grant MUST also set the `operator` user mode (`+o`, FR-044)
  on that session in the same act — a client observing that session's
  user modes (via its own `MODE` query, FR-044, or another client's
  `WHOIS`, FR-037) MUST see it reflected immediately, not only through
  administrator-only commands becoming usable.
- **FR-035**: The capability-negotiation mechanism itself (FR-006, FR-007,
  FR-008 — a client's ability to request the capability list and negotiate
  a subset) MUST always be available and MUST NOT be an optional extension
  subject to FR-011 toggling. Only the individual capabilities it offers
  (FR-025's `message-tags`, `server-time`, `echo-message`) are optional,
  independently toggleable extensions; disabling all of them MUST still
  leave a client able to perform capability negotiation and simply receive
  an empty or reduced capability list.
- **FR-036**: Channel moderation (FR-013, FR-014 — channel-operator
  designation and standard moderation actions) is core protocol behavior,
  equivalent to user modes and channel modes in standard IRC, and MUST
  always be available. It MUST NOT be an optional extension subject to
  FR-011 toggling; an administrator MUST NOT be able to disable moderation
  capability network-wide.
- **FR-037**: The server MUST support a user-lookup command allowing a
  registered client to query information — at minimum nickname, ident,
  presented hostname, and real name — about a target nickname, or about
  themselves if no target is given. Like channel moderation (FR-036) and
  capability negotiation (FR-035), this is core protocol behavior and
  MUST NOT be an optional extension subject to FR-011 toggling. If the
  target currently holds the `operator` user mode (`+o`, FR-044), the
  lookup MUST additionally indicate that — unlike the hostname
  resolution FR-038 defines, this indication is visible to *any* querying
  client, not gated by administrator privilege or self-lookup, matching
  standard IRC's `WHOIS` behavior (an operator's status is public
  information; their real hostname is not).
- **FR-038**: The hostname/IP value FR-037's lookup returns for the target
  MUST be resolved as follows, evaluated in order:
  1. If the querying client **is** the target (a self-lookup), the server
     MUST return the target's real, unobfuscated hostname/IP, regardless
     of whether a cloaking extension currently obscures it from other
     clients — a client's own data is never hidden from itself.
  2. Otherwise, if the querying client holds administrator privilege
     (FR-033), the server MUST return the target's real, unobfuscated
     hostname/IP, consistent with FR-032's `WHOHOST`-equivalent
     guarantee.
  3. Otherwise, the server MUST return the same presented (display) value
     the target's message hostmask already shows to that querying client
     (FR-030, cloak-obscured per FR-031 if a cloaking extension is
     enabled, the real value otherwise) — the server MUST NOT expose a
     target's real, unobfuscated hostname/IP to a non-administrator
     client looking up a *different* client, under any circumstance.
- **FR-039**: The server MUST detect a connection that has gone silent
  without a clean disconnect — one whose underlying network path stopped
  working without a TCP-level close ever arriving — by probing it after a
  period of inactivity and, if it does not respond within a bounded
  timeout, treating it exactly like any other disconnect for FR-017's
  cleanup and notification purposes. The server MUST also respond to a
  client-initiated liveness probe immediately, regardless of whether the
  server has probed that connection itself.
- **FR-040**: The server MUST allow any client to view a channel's current
  topic (or a clear "no topic set" indication if none has been set) —
  subject to FR-047's private/secret exception — and MUST allow a
  channel operator to set or change it, notifying current members of the
  change. The server MUST reject a topic-change attempt from a member
  who is not a channel operator with a clear permissions error, reusing
  the same channel-operator concept FR-013 already establishes rather
  than introducing a separate one.
- **FR-041**: The server MUST allow a registered client to request the
  current membership list of a named channel on demand — not only as part
  of joining it — regardless of whether the requesting client is
  currently a member of that channel, subject to FR-047's private/secret
  exception.
- **FR-042**: The server MUST allow a registered client to request a list
  of the server's currently active channels, subject to FR-047's
  private/secret exception.
- **FR-043**: The server's channel mode mechanism MUST directly and
  unconditionally implement exactly the two moderation flags FR-013
  defines (moderated-mode, members-only) as core behavior — never gated
  by whether any optional extension is enabled (FR-036). That mechanism
  MUST also be built so that an optional server extension can introduce
  additional channel-mode flags without requiring a change to the
  server's core codebase (FR-011's existing guarantee, applied to mode
  flags specifically) — for example, a future extension supporting
  registered-channel identity could add a flag for that, the way classic
  IRC networks use a registered-channel mode. A mode flag with no
  definition at all — neither core's nor a currently-enabled extension's
  — and a mode query with no flag argument, MUST both be rejected with
  the same specific, actionable "unsupported mode" error FR-013's other
  operator-gated actions use — never silently ignored, misapplied, or
  answered with a fabricated result. No extension in this release defines
  an additional flag; the mechanism exists now so one can be added later
  without revisiting this requirement. This extensibility guarantee
  covers simple on/off flags like the two FR-013 already defines; a
  channel mode that instead carries a value (e.g., a numeric limit) or a
  list (e.g., a set of masks) is a structurally different case this
  requirement does not promise a mechanism for yet — see Assumptions.
  Critically, the guarantee is not limited to flags that restrict sending
  a channel message: an on/off flag that instead restricts *joining* the
  channel (e.g., a future invite-only extension) MUST be equally
  addable without a core-codebase change — the mechanism's extension
  point MUST be defined in terms of "which action does this flag gate,"
  not hardcoded to the one action (sending) this release's two built-in
  flags happen to gate.
- **FR-044**: The server MUST implement a user-level mode mechanism,
  using the same open, extension-friendly design FR-043 establishes for
  channel modes — a named, non-closed set of flags, each defined by
  either core or an optional server extension, so a future flag is an
  extension addition, not a core-codebase change. This release
  core-defines exactly one user-mode flag: `operator` (`o`), which
  MUST be set on a session the moment it is granted administrator
  privilege (FR-034) and MUST be clearable by that session on itself at
  any time, revoking administrator privilege as the same act — the flag
  and the privilege are one fact, not two independently-tracked pieces
  of state that could drift apart. Unlike channel modes, this release's
  user-mode mechanism is deliberately narrower in three ways, since
  nothing beyond `operator` motivates the fuller shape yet: (1) a
  session MAY only ever query or change its *own* user modes, never
  another session's — an attempt to target a different nickname MUST be
  rejected with a clear, specific error, the same posture FR-058 already
  takes for `SAMODE`; (2) `operator` MAY only be *set* by the
  FR-034 grant itself, never directly by a client's own mode command — a
  non-privileged session attempting to set it directly MUST be rejected
  with the same privilege error FR-033's other administrator-only
  actions use, since setting it is exactly equivalent to self-granting
  administrator privilege; (3) an already-satisfied set (already an
  operator, setting `+o` again) or an already-absent clear (not an
  operator, clearing `-o`) MUST be treated as a harmless no-op, not an
  error. A user-mode command naming a flag neither core nor any
  currently-enabled extension defines MUST be rejected with a clear,
  specific error distinct from FR-043's channel-mode equivalent — same
  posture (reject an undefined flag explicitly), different numeral
  (they are different commands). This mechanism's flag catalog is what
  the Registration Completion Burst's user-mode letter list (FR-051)
  reads from — no longer an always-empty list now that `operator`
  exists. `RPL_ISUPPORT` (FR-055) advertises no equivalent token for
  user modes, matching real IRC convention — only `004`'s letter list
  covers them.
- **FR-045**: The server MUST allow a channel operator to grant a "voice"
  privilege to a specific member, and to later revoke it, the same way
  standard IRC does — restricted to operators, the same as every other
  moderation action (FR-013, FR-014). While moderated-mode restriction
  (FR-013) is active, the server MUST permit a voiced member to send
  channel messages in addition to operators — moderated mode's complete
  definition is "operators and voiced members may send," not
  "operators only." A non-existent target, or one who isn't currently a
  member of the channel, MUST be rejected with a clear error rather than
  silently granting a privilege to no one.
- **FR-046**: The server MUST allow a channel operator to grant operator
  status to another member, and to revoke operator status (including
  their own), the same way voice is granted and revoked (FR-045) —
  restricted to operators, the same as every other moderation action
  (FR-013, FR-014) — with one exception: an administrator granting
  themselves operator status via the dedicated self-op command (FR-058)
  does not need to already hold operator status, by design. This is in
  addition to, not a replacement for, first-join-gets-operator (FR-013)
  as how a channel's very first operator is established: it's how
  operator status subsequently spreads to other members. A non-existent
  target, or one who isn't currently a
  member of the channel, MUST be rejected with a clear error rather than
  silently granting a privilege to no one.
- **FR-047**: The server MUST allow a channel operator to mark a channel
  private or secret (restricted to operators, the same as every other
  moderation action, FR-013/FR-014), and MUST hide such a channel's
  existence from a non-member: topic-viewing (FR-040), membership listing
  (FR-041), and the active-channel list (FR-042) MUST each treat that
  channel exactly as they would treat one that does not exist for a
  non-member requester, not merely refuse with a distinguishable
  "access denied" response — a non-member MUST NOT be able to tell "this
  channel doesn't exist" apart from "this channel exists but is hidden."
  A channel's own members MUST see it normally, with no restriction. An
  administrator (FR-033) MUST also see it normally regardless of
  membership, the same transparency guarantee FR-032 already gives
  administrators over cloaked hostnames. Private and secret MAY be
  treated identically in this release (both hide equally, the way
  `secret` already unambiguously must); this specification does not
  require distinguishing a softer "listed but obscured" variant some
  historical IRC networks gave private channels.
- **FR-048**: A channel name MUST conform to a defined grammar: a leading
  `#` followed by additional characters, excluding space, comma, and
  control characters, up to the server's configured maximum channel name
  length (FR-056; 50 characters total, including the leading `#`, by
  default) — the same rigor already applied to nickname format (FR-002's
  uniqueness rule is a separate, independent check from this one,
  mirroring how nickname format and nickname uniqueness are independent
  checks). A `JOIN` attempt naming a channel that violates this grammar
  MUST be rejected with a clear, specific error distinct from the
  "nickname in use"-style error FR-002 defines, not silently accepted as
  a new channel's identity.
- **FR-049**: The server MUST enforce a maximum protocol line length of
  512 bytes (including the trailing CR-LF) for a message's command and
  parameters, plus up to 4096 additional bytes for the message-tags
  section specifically, per the IRCv3 message-tags specification's
  required server-side allowance (FR-025 — this server implements
  message-tags, so this allowance applies). A line exceeding either
  budget MUST be rejected with a specific, actionable error distinct
  from FR-015's other malformed-message cases — not silently truncated,
  partially processed, or lumped in with a generic "malformed command"
  response the sender would have to guess the actual cause of.
- **FR-050**: The server MUST have an administrator-configurable name,
  used as the source of every server-originated protocol message
  (numeric replies, and any other message whose sender is the server
  itself rather than a client) — the structural counterpart to FR-030's
  client hostmask prefix, but identifying the server, not a user. If the
  administrator has not explicitly configured one, the server MUST fall
  back to a reasonable default rather than sending messages with an
  empty or malformed source (see Assumptions). The server's name MUST
  contain at least one "." character, whether administrator-configured
  or defaulted — an administrator-supplied value without one MUST be
  rejected the same way any other invalid configuration value is
  (FR-012). This is not cosmetic: a nickname (FR-002's grammar) can never
  contain a ".", so a dot-free server name would be indistinguishable
  from a nickname to a client parsing a message's source, exactly the
  ambiguity real IRC clients rely on the "." to resolve.
- **FR-051**: Upon successful registration completion (FR-001), the
  server MUST send the newly registered client a registration-completion
  burst consisting of, in order: a welcome confirmation; the server's own
  identification (its name, FR-050, and software version); the set
  of user-mode and channel-mode letters currently recognized (core plus
  any currently-enabled extension's, FR-043/FR-044's mode mechanism);
  the server's supported-features advertisement (FR-055). Since this
  release implements no message-of-the-day content, the server MUST
  conclude the burst with the standard "no message-of-the-day"
  indication rather than leaving the client to wait indefinitely for a
  burst-completion signal that will never arrive — a client MUST be able
  to treat this indication as "registration burst finished," not just
  RPL_WELCOME alone.
- **FR-052**: Nicknames and channel names MUST be compared
  case-insensitively wherever the server determines whether two names
  are "the same" — uniqueness checks (FR-002, FR-003), and resolving the
  target of any command that names a nickname or channel (e.g.,
  `PRIVMSG`, `WHOIS`, `KICK`, `MODE`, `TOPIC`, `NAMES`) — using IRC's
  traditional casemapping, not simple byte-for-byte comparison: standard
  ASCII letters fold together (`A`-`Z` with `a`-`z`), and in addition
  `[` folds with `{`, `]` with `}`, `\` with `|`, and `^` with `~` (RFC
  2812 §2.2 — IRC's Scandinavian-origin casemapping, still the
  near-universal default across deployed IRC networks today). A client
  registered as "Alice" MUST be reachable via `PRIVMSG alice`, and MUST
  block a second client from also registering "alice" or "ALICE".
- **FR-053**: A numeric reply sent to a session that has not yet
  completed registration (FR-001) — most notably `431`/`432`/`433`, all
  of which can fire while a client is still negotiating its nickname —
  MUST address that reply to `*` (the standard placeholder for "no
  nickname yet"), not an empty value, not a value the client hasn't
  claimed yet, and not omitted entirely.
- **FR-054**: Message text the server interprets as human-readable
  content — `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE` bodies, channel topics, realnames,
  channel names (FR-048's grammar, further constrained by this
  requirement), and `QUIT`/`PART` reasons (FR-060) — MUST be valid
  UTF-8. The server MUST reject a message containing an invalid UTF-8
  byte sequence in one of these fields as malformed (FR-015), the same
  way any other malformed protocol message is rejected — not pass the
  invalid bytes through unvalidated, mistranscode them, or silently
  discard just the invalid portion while accepting the rest. This does
  not apply to nicknames, which already have their own strict,
  ASCII-only grammar (FR-002) that valid UTF-8 membership doesn't add
  anything to.
- **FR-055**: As part of the registration-completion burst (FR-051), the
  server MUST advertise its feature/limit support to the newly
  registered client via the standard `RPL_ISUPPORT` mechanism (the de
  facto reuse of numeric `005` virtually every deployed IRC server and
  client relies on today, not RFC 2812's original `RPL_BOUNCE` meaning —
  see Assumptions), split across as many lines as needed to respect
  FR-049's line-length limit. At minimum, this release MUST advertise:
  the casemapping in effect (FR-052); which channel-name prefix
  character(s) are recognized (FR-048); the maximum nickname length
  (contracts/irc-protocol-commands.md "Connection Registration
  Grammar"); the maximum channel name length (FR-048); the maximum
  channel topic length (FR-056); the currently-recognized channel-mode
  letters, in the standard grouped-by-parameter-behavior form (FR-043);
  the member-status prefix characters for operator and voice
  (FR-045/FR-046); and that the server enforces UTF-8 for message text
  (FR-054), using the standard `UTF8ONLY` token. A future server
  extension contributing an additional channel-mode flag (FR-043) MUST
  be reflected here the same way it is already reflected in `004`'s
  mode-letter list (FR-051) — one source of truth for which channel-mode
  flags are currently recognized, not two independently-maintained lists
  that could drift apart.
- **FR-056**: The server MUST allow an administrator to configure the
  maximum length of a nickname, a channel name, and a channel topic
  independently, each defaulting to this specification's baseline value
  when not explicitly configured (nickname: 9 characters, FR-002's
  grammar; channel name: 50 characters including the leading `#`,
  FR-048; topic: 390 characters, a widely-used real-world IRC default —
  see Assumptions). Each configured value MUST be a positive integer and
  MUST NOT exceed 400 characters, rejected at load time with the same
  specific, actionable error any other invalid configuration value gets
  (FR-012) if violated — the 400-character ceiling keeps every field
  comfortably within FR-049's 512-byte base line budget once command
  framing (command name, target, sigils, CR-LF) is accounted for,
  regardless of which field is involved. A configured value MUST be
  enforced everywhere the corresponding baseline currently is — nickname
  and channel name length are already part of FR-002's/FR-048's grammar
  checks (`432`/`476`) and simply become parameterized by this
  configuration rather than a fixed constant — and MUST be reflected in
  the `RPL_ISUPPORT` advertisement (FR-055) so a client never has to
  discover the actual enforced limit by trial and error. A channel
  topic-change attempt (FR-040) exceeding the configured topic length is
  a new enforcement case with no prior length check of its own: the
  server MUST reject it with the same `417 ERR_INPUTTOOLONG` error
  FR-049 already uses for an oversized protocol line — the same class of
  "input exceeds a configured length limit" failure — not silently
  truncate it to fit.
- **FR-057**: The server MUST provide a dedicated in-band command,
  restricted to administrator privilege (FR-033), through which an
  administrator joins any channel by name — creating it if it doesn't
  exist (FR-003) or joining an existing one — bypassing every
  currently-active channel-mode flag that gates `JOIN` (FR-043's `gates`
  mechanism), the same class of restriction a future invite-only-style
  extension would enforce against an ordinary client's `JOIN`. This is a
  distinct, explicit command from ordinary `JOIN`, not a privilege
  bypass silently applied to `JOIN` itself — an administrator's regular
  `JOIN` remains subject to the same gates as anyone else's, so bypass
  only happens when deliberately invoked. It does not bypass the
  nickname/channel-name grammar (FR-002/FR-048) or UTF-8 validity
  (FR-054) — a malformed channel name is rejected the normal way — and
  it does not itself grant operator status (FR-058 is the separate
  mechanism for that). No channel-mode flag defined this release
  actually gates `JOIN` (FR-043's `gates` mechanism has no such flag
  yet), so this command has no observable bypass effect yet, the same
  "mechanism exists now, no flag exercises it yet" posture FR-043
  itself already establishes — but it MUST be wired to the same
  `JOIN`-gate check point ordinary `JOIN` uses, so a future
  JOIN-gating extension is bypassed by administrators automatically,
  without further changes to this command.
- **FR-058**: The server MUST provide a dedicated in-band command,
  restricted to administrator privilege (FR-033) and to a sender who is
  currently a member of the target channel, through which an
  administrator grants or revokes channel-operator status on
  themselves specifically — regardless of whether they already hold
  it, and regardless of whether the channel already has one or more
  existing operators (the exception FR-046 itself names). This command
  MUST be scoped to the sender's own membership only — it MUST NOT
  accept or apply to a different target nickname; granting operator
  status to someone else remains exclusively FR-046's mechanism,
  restricted to existing operators. A sender who isn't currently a
  member of the target channel MUST be rejected with the standard
  "not on channel" error rather than being implicitly joined — FR-057's
  force-join command is the separate, explicit step for that.
- **FR-059**: The server MUST assign a unique identifier to every message
  it relays to one or more clients (channel messages, direct messages,
  and other server-relayed events alike), generated by the server
  itself — never derived from message content, never client-supplied.
  Two distinct messages MUST NOT receive the same identifier, and one
  message's identifier MUST be the same value for every recipient of
  that message, the same "computed once, shared across every recipient"
  invariant FR-025's `server-time` timestamp already has. For a
  recipient that has negotiated the `message-tags` capability (FR-025),
  the server MUST include this identifier as the standard `msgid`
  message tag on that message; a recipient that has not negotiated
  `message-tags` MUST NOT receive it, since a tag cannot be sent without
  that capability's framing in the first place. This is not a new,
  independently-toggleable capability of its own — unlike `server-time`,
  which exists as a separate capability specifically because a client
  might reasonably want tag framing without timestamps or vice versa,
  nothing suggests a client would want `message-tags` without message
  identification also being available, so `msgid` is simply part of what
  `message-tags` itself provides once negotiated.
- **FR-060**: The server MUST allow a client to voluntarily end its own
  connection at any time — including before registration completes, not
  only afterward — via a dedicated `QUIT` command, optionally supplying
  a human-readable reason. A voluntary `QUIT` MUST use the same
  cleanup and notification FR-017 already requires for a lost
  connection (channel membership removal, notification to every
  affected channel) — `QUIT` is the client-initiated trigger for that
  cleanup, not a separate mechanism from it, and is the same shared
  cleanup path a keep-alive timeout (FR-039) or an abrupt, unexpected
  disconnect also triggers. The notification sent to affected channels
  MUST always carry a reason: the client-supplied one if `QUIT` gave
  one, or a server-supplied default if it didn't or if the disconnect
  wasn't client-initiated at all (e.g., a keep-alive timeout) — never an
  empty or blank reason, since "no reason given" and "no notification
  content at all" are different things a client shouldn't have to guess
  between. A session that has not yet completed registration MAY still
  send `QUIT` to cleanly close its connection — it simply has no channel
  memberships yet to clean up, not a case this command needs to reject.

### Key Entities

- **Client Session**: A single connected client's live state — its
  network connection, registration status, negotiated capabilities,
  authentication status, and channel memberships.
- **User Identity**: The persistent, human-recognizable identity a client
  presents (nickname, and optionally a verified account), independent of
  any single connection. Presented on the wire in the standard
  `nickname!ident@hostname` form (FR-030). The `hostname` portion MAY be
  obfuscated for other clients by an optional cloaking extension (FR-031),
  but the real value is always retained internally and remains visible to
  administrators (FR-032) and to the user-lookup command (FR-037/FR-038)
  when a client looks itself up or an administrator looks anyone up —
  never to a non-administrator client looking up someone else.
- **Administrator Privilege**: A server-wide grant on a Client Session,
  obtained via FR-034's in-band credential command, that authorizes
  FR-032's administrative commands. Distinct from channel-operator status
  (Channel entity) and independent of the deferred Account entity.
- **Account** *(deferred with Story 3 — not present in the initial
  release)*: A registered identity managed by the account module
  (built-in or external), distinct from a nickname — one account may be
  associated with a nickname registration and/or one or more registered
  channels, and persists independently of any single connection or
  session.
- **Channel**: A named, joinable group through which multiple clients
  exchange messages; tracks its membership list, operator/privilege
  assignments, moderation settings, and an optional topic (FR-040) — set
  only by an operator, visible to any client (FR-040/FR-041), unlike
  moderation settings which govern who may send. In a later release, once the
  account module exists, a channel MAY be registered to an Account, in
  which case its operator/privilege assignments are sourced from that
  account's access records (FR-026) instead of join order; the initial
  release has no such registration.
- **Capability**: A named, independently negotiable protocol enhancement
  that a client may request; has an availability state (offered/not
  offered) determined by which extensions are currently enabled.
- **Extension**: An independently enableable/disableable unit of optional
  server functionality (e.g., an individual capability, a command set, or
  an additional channel/user-mode flag, FR-043/FR-044) configured by the
  administrator. Core protocol behavior — channel moderation's two
  built-in mode flags (FR-036) and the capability-negotiation mechanism
  itself (FR-035) — is never modeled as an Extension; it is always
  present. An *additional* mode flag beyond those two, once one exists,
  would be — the mechanism, not the two built-in flags, is what's core.
- **Server Configuration**: The administrator-controlled settings
  determining which extensions are active and how core and optional
  behavior is tuned — including the server's own name (FR-050), used as
  the source of every server-originated message, defaulting to the
  deployment host's network hostname if unconfigured.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A new user can go from initial connection to successfully
  sending their first channel message in under 10 seconds using any
  standard IRC client.
- **SC-002**: Messages sent to a channel are delivered to all other
  members of that channel within 1 second under normal operating
  conditions.
- **SC-003**: The server sustains at least 1,000 simultaneously connected
  clients without message delivery delay exceeding the 1-second target in
  SC-002.
- **SC-004**: A capability-aware client can complete capability discovery
  and negotiation in a single round trip before registration completes.
- **SC-005**: An administrator can change which optional extensions are
  active using configuration alone — no code changes, rebuild, or server
  restart — and observe the effect reflected for connected and new
  clients within 1 minute of applying the change.
- **SC-006**: During a sustained burst of excessive traffic from a single
  connection, message delivery latency for all other, well-behaved
  clients does not increase beyond the SC-002 target.
- **SC-007** *(Deferred with Story 3 — not an initial-release gate)*: 100%
  of authentication attempts with valid credentials succeed, and 100% of
  attempts with invalid credentials are rejected, across repeated
  testing.
- **SC-008**: Administrators can identify the cause of a configuration
  error from the reported error message alone, without consulting source
  code, in under 5 minutes.
- **SC-009**: An authorized administrator can gain administrator privilege
  and enable/disable an extension entirely through in-band IRC client
  commands — no file system or configuration-file access to the server
  host required — with the same effect and timing as SC-005.
- **SC-010**: Across repeated testing, 100% of non-administrator lookups
  of a *different* client's information return that client's presented
  hostname, never its real hostname/IP; 100% of self-lookups and
  administrator lookups return the real hostname/IP.

## Assumptions

- The implementation platform is Java, per explicit stakeholder direction;
  specific frameworks, libraries, and build tooling are determined during
  technical planning and are out of scope for this specification.
- "Modular" is interpreted as: optional functionality — individual
  extensions (capabilities, command sets) — can be independently enabled,
  disabled, and configured by an administrator without modifying core
  server code and without restarting the running server process (FR-011).
  Channel moderation and the capability-negotiation mechanism are
  explicitly core, always-present behavior, not part of this optional-
  extension surface (FR-035, FR-036). This applies to toggling existing
  extensions on/off; whether entirely new, third-party extensions can be
  installed at runtime without a restart is not required by this
  specification and is a planning-phase design choice.
- Authentication (Story 3, FR-009/FR-010) and the account module
  (FR-023/FR-024) are deferred and not required for the first iteration;
  when they are implemented, authentication remains optional per-connection
  by default, and an administrator MAY configure the server to require it
  as a configuration concern rather than a change to FR-009 itself.
- The optional TLS connection offering (FR-018) uses standard transport
  encryption; certificate management approach is a planning concern, not
  a specification concern.
- Rate limiting/flood protection (FR-016, SC-006) uses reasonable
  industry-standard defaults, configurable by the administrator, rather
  than a single fixed universal threshold.
- Connection keep-alive (FR-039) uses reasonable industry-standard
  probe-interval and response-timeout defaults, not exposed as an
  administrator-configurable Server Configuration setting in this
  release — unlike rate limiting's thresholds, which FR-016 already
  requires to be tunable.
- The server does not enforce its own maximum-connections cap or send a
  dedicated capacity-exceeded rejection at the protocol level; SC-003's
  1,000-connection floor is a sustained-operation target the server MUST
  meet, not a ceiling with special in-protocol handling once exceeded.
  Capacity beyond what's actually sustained is bounded by OS/network
  resources and whatever an administrator configures at the deployment
  layer (e.g., a reverse proxy, container resource limits), not by this
  specification.
- If the administrator does not configure a server name (FR-050), the
  server falls back to the deployment host's own network hostname rather
  than an empty or placeholder value — a reasonable, zero-configuration
  default consistent with how most real IRC servers behave, not a value
  requiring administrator action before the server can start. If that
  hostname itself doesn't contain a "." (common for a bare local/
  container hostname with no domain suffix), the server appends a fixed,
  clearly-synthetic suffix (e.g., `.local`) so FR-050's dot requirement
  holds even in the zero-configuration case, rather than only being
  enforced against explicit administrator input. The server's software
  version (used alongside the name, FR-051) is derived from the
  build/release itself, not administrator-configured — sourced from the
  build system's own version identifier at build time, never entered or
  overridden separately.
- FR-055's `RPL_ISUPPORT` advertisement is deliberately a fixed,
  minimal set — only tokens this specification already has a concrete,
  decided answer for. Tokens some real networks advertise but this
  release has no defined limit or behavior for (e.g., a per-client
  channel-join limit, a network name distinct from FR-050's server name,
  multi-target `PRIVMSG`) are omitted rather than advertised with an
  invented value — an absent token is the standard, correct way to say
  "unspecified," not a gap to fill with a guess.
- FR-056's topic-length default (390 characters) is not an RFC value —
  RFC 2812 defines no topic length at all — but a widely-used real-world
  IRC default (several deployed networks converge on it), chosen over
  inventing an arbitrary number of this specification's own. The shared
  400-character ceiling on all three configurable lengths (nickname,
  channel name, topic) exists purely to keep configuration mistakes from
  producing a value that can never fit a valid protocol line under
  FR-049's 512-byte budget — it is a safety bound, not a target value
  administrators are expected to configure up to.
- Channel modes beyond moderated-mode and members-only (FR-013/FR-043),
  and user modes beyond `operator` (FR-044), are recognized at the
  wire-protocol level — a future client library can still parse them
  from any server — but their behavior is deferred past this release,
  the same treatment already given to `AUTHENTICATE`/SASL (Story 3) and
  `NickServ`/`ChanServ`-style commands. This is a scope boundary, not an
  oversight: FR-013's two implemented channel flags and FR-044's one
  implemented user flag are what this release's actual stories need
  (Story 5's moderation; administrator visibility, this change), and
  nothing in this release depends on any other mode existing.
  Unlike those other deferrals, though, FR-043/FR-044 also commit to *how*
  a later mode gets added: via an optional server extension contributing
  it (research.md "Channel/user mode extensibility"), not a core-codebase
  change — so a later release (or a third-party extension) can add, say,
  a registered-channel/user flag once account registration exists,
  without this specification needing to be revisited first. That
  commitment covers simple on/off flags only. Standard IRC's
  value-carrying (e.g. a numeric limit) and list-type (e.g. a mask list)
  channel modes are cataloged for reference (contracts/
  irc-protocol-commands.md "Full Channel Mode Catalog") but have no
  extension mechanism defined yet — deliberately: no extension needs one,
  and guessing the right shape without a concrete consumer risks building
  the wrong thing.
- No mobile app, web client, or GUI is in scope — this specification
  covers the server and its protocol behavior only; any client software
  is out of scope.
- Server-to-server federation is deferred past initial release (see
  FR-021). It is not assumed to fit Story 4's client-facing extension
  system (individual capabilities, command sets) — federation's
  server-to-server trust boundary and distributed state make it a
  different kind of extension, whose own mechanism is a planning-phase
  decision to be made when federation is actually scoped. What this
  specification does commit to now is narrower: the specific core
  behaviors named in FR-022 (nickname/channel uniqueness scope, channel
  message delivery, connection-loss handling) must be implemented so a
  later federation effort doesn't require redesigning them, plus two
  standing constraints on that future effort itself — extension
  consistency across linked servers (FR-028) and a single authoritative
  account source network-wide (FR-029).
- The `ident` portion of FR-030's `nickname!ident@hostname` identity is
  derived from the username the client supplies at registration (FR-001),
  not from an RFC 1413 IDENT-protocol lookup against the client's host —
  IDENT-protocol verification is out of scope for this release.
- FR-034's administrator-privilege mechanism intentionally mirrors the
  classic IRC OPER pattern (credentials defined in server-side
  configuration, verified in-band) specifically because it must not depend
  on the deferred account module; if Story 3 is later implemented, whether
  administrator privilege should additionally support account-based
  grants is a decision for that future work, not this release.
