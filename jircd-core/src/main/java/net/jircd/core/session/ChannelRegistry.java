/**
 * Server-wide channel-name uniqueness with create-on-first-join (FR-003), compared using the same
 * rfc1459 casemapping as {@link NicknameRegistry} (FR-052) — {@code #Foo} and {@code #foo} resolve
 * to one channel, storing whichever casing created it. Its narrow public surface leaves room to
 * later span servers without callers changing (FR-022).
 *
 * <p>Backed by a synchronized, insertion-ordered map rather than a lock-free {@code
 * ConcurrentHashMap} — {@link #all()}'s iteration order needs to be deterministic (creation order)
 * for a bare {@code NAMES} (006-complete-core-protocol FR-010) to have a stable, repeatable
 * response shape; channel creation/removal is low-frequency compared to per-message traffic, so a
 * single lock here has no measurable contention risk.
